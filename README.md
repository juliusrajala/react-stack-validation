# React Typescript Template

This is a slightly opinionated starter kit for a React Application using Typescript.

I'm a big fan of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and for the most part, would still recommend using CRA as a template for your React Apps over this one.

I still figured I'd provide an option due to a few discussions I've had with people who have felt they'd like a slightly lighter starter package. That's where this is supposed to step in.

## Usage

Relatively simple usage. The package comes with a few npm scripts to get you started quickly.

After cloning the repository:

### Development
```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

### Build and serve locally

`$ npm serve`
